									<h3 class="major">Background</h3>
									<p>Currently there are estimated to be 308,000 individuals in the United States suffering from spinal cord injuries (SCI) with 18,000 new cases each year [1]. There are two primary sources of spinal cord injuries, those caused by diseases, typically congenital defects, and those caused by traumatic injuries like motor vehicle crashes and violent crime. SCIs cause life-lasting impairments such as poor mobility, incontinence, and loss of independence. Patients with spinal cord injuries often need lifetime treatment that can be difficult to find coverage for and impose a significant economic burden on individuals and healthcare workers responsible for care. While current treatment solutions are unable to cure full paralysis, many of the problems associated with SCI such as incontinence and muscle weakness can be relieved through rehabilitation or implanted spinal cord stimulators (SCS). These systems work by helping to strengthen and reconnect neural pathways, but these options are often costly or may be inaccessible due to insurance limitations. Moreover, conventional SCS devices require surgery, and transcutaneous SCS (tSCS) devices can cause uneven current distribution, leading to discomfort or painful stimulation. With a necessity to improve current distribution and electrode adhesive efficiency, new materials are being developed.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Problem and Need</h3>
										<h4>Problem</h4>
											<blockquote>SCI patients have few options of treatments for spinal cord injuries that can aid in the recovery of basic needs like incontinence or temperature regulation. Existing solutions are expensive, invasive, and require significant medical assistance.</blockquote>
										<h4>Need Statement</h4>
											<blockquote>A way to uniformly administer electrical current to the skin for tSCS in patients with SCI to improve homeostasis, motor control, and sensory function.</blockquote>
										<h4>Our Solution</h4>
											<blockquote>Low-cost liquid metal gallium-based hydrogel electrode with a custom-built stimulation device to improve transcutaneous current directed into the spine and provide patients with a more convenient means of at-home and in-clinic therapy.</blockquote>

									<h3 class="major">Verification and Validation</h3>
									<p>Verification testing of the hydrogel confirmed that it met the “stretchable” constraint at over 100% elongation. The hydrogel is adhesive and has no heat generation. The current distribution was evenly distributed through the hydrogel, with voltage measurements ranging from 8.29-8.37 V when connected to a 8.5 V source. The hydrogel is biocompatible and meets IEC, ISO, and FDA standards. Additionally, the device delivered 120 V and 150 mA of biphasic power for stimulation.  Current studies show that up to 150 mA of biphasic current generate action potentials for neurorehabilitation with tSCS [2]; however, future testing will involve measuring action potentials invoked by our device in the spinal cord through electrodes.</p>
